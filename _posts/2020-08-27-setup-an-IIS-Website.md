When visiting a webpage on the internet, you are accessing files on someone else's computer. Taking this basic concept into mind, we will be creating our own webpage using Windows IIS.

## **Creating our first website**

### **Pre-reqs**


- Before configuring IIS, we need to create a directory to host our website files. Open File Explorer, navigate to `This PC`, `Windows (C:)`, then create a new folder named `Websites`. Inside of that folder, create a new folder named `MyWebsite`. All your website files will live inside of this directory.

### **Making the site**

1. After installation of IIS, creating and hosting your own website is fairly simple.
2. Hit the windows key and type in `IIS` and select `Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager`, which should bring up a control panel for all IIS services.

7. Navigate to `http://localhost` once more and you should see your new website. Congrats!

<!--So what does IIS do? It simply shows people who show up, the files that live in your websites directory. Think of it as someone showing up to your house, and then looking at your doormat. -->

<!--Also, congrats if you found this lmao -->
